* User Stories
** MVP
- As a user I would like to be able to quickly on a single form that is easily used by touch even when my hands hurt journal about how I felt today including pain level, stiffness, fatigue, and sleep.
- As a user I would like to be able to note important life events that effected my symptoms like diet, activity, changes in medication.
- As a user I would like to see a list of the notes I had made.
- As a user I would like to be able to create, edit, delete these notes
- As a user I would like to see a list of common reputible resources where I can learn about my condition, treatment options, and connect with users like myself
** Stretch
- As a user I would like to see a graph of these observations in context of these events and identify trends.
- As a user I would like to be able to search these notes by entering a search string
- As a user I would like to see information from my google fit like steps, move minutes,
- As a user I would like to be able to share a particular note to my social media

* Technical implimentation
** MVP
This app will be implimented using the MERN stack as a SPA that will provide data needed to render the following pages
*** Today
 - Enter details about how you are feeling today
 - Note important events that happened today
 - Add Notes
*** History
- Show a list of entries you can edit or delete
*** Notes
- Read Edit Create Notes
*** Resources
- Provide links to common resources where people can learn and connect with other users living with the same problems

** Strech
*** Add activity from the google fit API to today/history/graph
See https://developers.google.com/fit
*** Log in with ...
Let users log in with android and apple authentication
*** Search notes
Search full text of notes
*** Graph
Show a graph of values taken from prior entries by week/month/year/all time

** Icebox

** Performance/offline functionality
The implimentation will essentially fetch the mongo documents pertaining to the user with history graph and notes essentially just presenting data drawn from the same documents in a differerent format. Logically it may be desirable in the future to fetch more incrimentally or deploy the same functionality as PWA or phone app via react native that would allow it to work properly offline.

**  Data Privacy
Consider the idea of encrypting data client side with user passphrase and just pushing encrypted data to the server

*** Upsides:
Users don't have to be concerned with you monetizing/sharing/accidentally losing their data
Trivial compliance with European privacy laws and requests to delete data

*** Downsides
Makes implimentation more complicated

Users can't lose their passphrase without losing access to prior data. This ought to be partially miigated by saving your password to google etc making it harder to permenently lose data but in my experience people still manage this feat.
